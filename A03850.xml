         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But thys tyme aſketh, yea craueth, other charge of me.</p>
            <p>Namelye, to ſhewe the argumente of thys my ſmall treatyſe, and dyſcloſe the chyefeſt cauſes of the tytle. That your Maieſtye, ſeeyng at one glymſe the whole ſumme, and vnderſtandynge wythall, what occaſyons moued me to wryte: both by your wyſedome maye more certaynelye knowe the whole cauſe, and accordynge to youre iudgemente, iudge vpryghtly thereof, and as beſt ſytteth your gracious fauoure, yf it ſeeme worthye your patronage, mayntayne and defende it, as a poore and naked Clyent, as wel againſt the cloſe whiſperynges, as open inuectyues of curyous Carpers.</p>
            <p>Seeynge Nobilitye ſpredde through all realmes and coaſtes of chryſtendome, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhe in all eſtates of honour, beare the ſway in pryncely courtes, and in maner the piller and ſtaye of all commen weales: and through it, eyther the greateſt aydes, or chiefeſt hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances conueyghed into mens life and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: I thought, this choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> order once ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wyth right &amp; chriſtian opinions, &amp; refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the vncorrupted ſquier of antiquity, both princes ſhold more ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly gouerne their

And therefore, conſidered, the deuine Plato, was not cauſe les chyefelye earneſt in his bookes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, That the wardens, otherwyſe the rulers, called to offyce in eche ſtate, and be guydes of the reſt: ſhoulde frome theyr you the vpwardes, be ſeaſoned with holyeſt preceptes and principles. For in theym he iudged, the weyghtyeſt parte, of ſuch goodes or euelles, as happe in the commen wealth to conſyſt. Nor was I ignoraunt of the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe, there were dyuers opinions: yea, ſome bookes wrytten. And infinite were it, to recken ſo many ſurmiſes, as touchynge it, are toſſed to and fro, in the monumentes of auncient Phyloſophers. For Anacharſes ſayde, the wyſe Prynce was happye. Socra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, who firſt could rule him ſelfe. Pittacus, who ſo ruled his ſubiectes, as they feared not hym but his. Others thynke him meetſt to be a prynce, who hath liued vnder a prince As Ageſilaus ſayeth, he ruleth well, whoe hath ſometyme obeyed.

And in this entrye (as it were) to diſcourſe a whyle, howe expedyente thys knowledge is, howe profytable, neceſſarye, aad meete, for theſe tymes, the handlynge of thys argumente.

Nor teach I onely mine owne opinion, but prooue it. And what erſt I ſupped oute of the ſwete ſprynges of the holy Bibles, and others not deſpiſed ryvers of good wryters: that nowe I apply to the enquirye and ſearche, of the ſource &amp; offpring of Nobilitye: to ſhewe the chanels &amp; braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the nature, doctrine, and duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. That it may caſely appeare by what ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tues it is kyndeled, by what vices quenched. Truly, thus I perſwade my ſelfe, Nobilitye
<pb facs="tcp:4513:5"/>is farre greater then manye conteyue of it. And the callyng heauenly but hard. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour lightſome, but the burthen heauye.</p>
            <p>And to vaunt and profeſſe him ſelfe, others ſuperiour and better: of all others the moſte maſſye charge. Nor place I the honour of Nobilitye in thoſe thynges, whyche ſo the commen people honoureth, hawkynge, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, haſtines, mightye power, vayne vaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, traynes of horſe, and ſeruauntes, ryot, myſchyefes, brauerye, royſtynge porte, or great lyne.

            <p>But thys accompte I the ſureſt ſygne and token of Nobilitye, howe muche men paſſe beaſtes, ſo muche the Nobles to excell the reſt: and by all the degrees and ſtayers of ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue, to clyme and ſcale, the ſteepe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they ſhall playnelye proue theym ſelues, deſcended of that reuerende, auncient, and Goddiſhe race: whyche for the excellencye of her vertue, and manye merites of mankynde, is deemed to haue had heauenlye byrth, and glyded from the ſkyes: and as the Sauiour and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of mankynd, is honoured with the tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and pennes of all men. Theſe are the true prooues, the Nobleſt Petygrees, and ſureſt oruamentes and armes of an aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtocke. To conclude, I thus defyne it.</p>
            <p>The hawtieſt, worthieſt, and honourableſt
<pb facs="tcp:4513:5"/>Nobilitye is that, whyche with the renoume and fame of aunceſtrye, hath coupled excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, Chryſtyan, and farre ſpred vertue.</p>

The other parte, is the ſtomake and ſtoute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a hygh and hawtye courage. For, as learnyng ſheweth howe iuſtly, and godly, to do, ſo this refuſeth no trauayle, no peryll, no torment, runneth into fyer, on weapons poin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, ventreth and beareth with a pryncelye courage, all haſards of life and limme: rather then ſuffer the duties we haue reckened, lye ſtayned or forſaken.

And herewythal ſtout and wyth a royall readynes inflamed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But O immortall God, would we but in thought ouerrunne all realmes, how fewe fynde we furniſhed with theſe vertues:</p>
            <p>Naye rather, howe many blemiſhd with con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary vices, and miſchieues? Howe fewe Ariſtides in Juſtice? Dauids or Joſias in religion?

Howe many, who not onely not guer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don learning and the learned, but euen hate, ſpyte, and condemne them? Howe fewe of them ſtoute warriours in Chriſtes cauſe, whom it behooued, to haue bene his ſouldy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, yea champions?

Wherefore, to ſuche ought this exhortacion worthelye, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitablye, and neceſſarilye be applyed, to moue them to ioyne and purchaſe aunciente No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſe, to this theyr newe gentrye, that all maye wyth one honeſt and commendable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulacion, be enflamed to one ſelfe deſyre. and lyke contencion, and ſtryfe towardes Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. I accompte it truly my labour worthe, that (though groſſely) I atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted to deſcribe the ryghte pathe to Nobilitye. Syth of it, whatſoeuer eyther felicitye or calamitye, is in our preſent ſtate, ſeemeth to iſſue. But, that my talke maye purchace better credyte, and wynne greater authoritye, I haue cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled to me, as a companion and felow The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus in my trauayle, the excellent, treatyſe of Philo a Iewe. Whom playnely, for the vſe of ſtudious &amp; noble young gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated out of Greeke into Latyne. That ioint<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly with the knoweledge of the tounge, they maye drynke godlynes. Thus heare you moſt noble Queene, what I treate. You haue alſo heard, what chyefelye moued me to it. But though neyther to Englande, nor our Nobilitye namelye my talke be referred, but generallye the cauſe it ſelfe debated, (god helpyng), to profyte al: yet after the cuſtome and wonte of wryters, meante I to flye to ſome ones protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnder ſhadow of whoſe defence I mought arreſt my ſelfe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chyefelye to you my Queene and pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, thought my ſelfe bounden to offer, this ſymple ſygnyfyeng of my obſeruaunce and
<pb facs="tcp:4513:7"/>duetye towardes you. Beſeechynge ye. thys ſmall volume of Nobles or Nobility, maye appeare vnder ſafeconducte and protection of your name. Not for I mynde to teache your Noble maieſtye any dutyes of Noby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litye: but for (whyche is no meane plague through all Chryſtendome) yf my choyce ſhould chaunce on ſome other, hardlye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes could he ſkyll the latyne phraſe.</p>
            <p>So ſhould I choſe ſome ſuch Tutor and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone, to defend my cauſe, as knewe it not.</p>
            <p>But on you, and your moſt victorious bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the kynge your father employed no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefyte, eyther greater or Nobler: then in pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>curyng ye to be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Farther meant I at thys preſent to beſeech your hyghenes, that for you knowe my fyrſt heſte, and gladlye (I hope) graunte it: you would next, chiefely furniſhe your court, (as moſt paynefullye and pollitikely ye do) with men famous for commendacion of Iuſtice, godlynes, and learning, And ſtudious &amp; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt appliers &amp; practiſers therof.

Whych is more wyſhed, for it is gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teleſt and moſt commodious for them. Which alſo I deſpayre not ſhortly to ſee. Both by your graue counſaylours aduyce, and other Nobles, and your owne preſident. For, as the rulers leade, ſo foloweth and formeth it ſelfe the rable reſt. Worthye it is, that Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarche noteth of Dioniſius. To whom lieng at Siracuſe when Plato came, whyle he gaue hym ſelfe to ſtudy of philoſophye, al the court was ſprent wyth duſt. And euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſwarmed wyth cluſters drawyng Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall fygures. But after his breache wyth Plato, when he forſooke philoſophye, and fell to women, and banketting: the other courtyers alyke, wyth chaunged moode, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered theyr myndes and thoughtes, to lyke of wantonneſſe of life, lyke hate &amp; contempt of duſt and learnynge. This therefore, maye be other cauſe, of my geuinge it to youre grace To propoſe your maieſtie paterne of the aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient dignifye, Image of tholde honour, and piller of true Nobilitye. That in a woman Noble men maye finde, what to learne, what to folowe, what to wonder. Whether they weygh your vpryghte Iuſtyce welcome to the good, dreadfull to the enemye: or the ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler learnynge, wherewyth euen to mens maſe, you are ſtoared: or your feruent zeale, loue, and furtherynge of religion, or your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:4513:8"/>and hawtye courage: who in greateſt tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peſtes and ſtormes, both a woman and ſole, weeld and ſteare, moſt wyſely and ſtoutelye the ſterne of ſo great a kyngdome. Whyche hawtyneſſe of ſtomake, to tonfyrme &amp; keepe I ſee I nede not exhorte you. For maye we doubt, but who with ſo ſynguler prudence, ſo ſweete conſent of all degrees, ſo quietely and happely reſtored the churche, myſerablye and horriblye deformed with erroures, ſuperſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and infinite heapes of Idolatrye, to the ſtate of her primitiue purenes: the ſame if yet any dregges remayne, anye limpinge or hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng, eyther in ordes or maners: wil with al helpe, care, councell, ſpeede, prouyde for it, withſtande it, and reforme it? For neyther wyl who began this good worke in you, not finiſhe it (to whom onelye belongeth to geue princelye mindes to prynces). Nor is youre wyſedome ignoraunt, what you do is Gods worke, not your owne. His y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe, yours the buyldynge. Wherein nor the feare of few nor murmuryng of many, ought withdrawe you from your forward foundacion. For, his wil it is, his temple ſhould be rayſed, the walles of Hieruſalem repayred. Our Cirus our anoynted, and Chryſte willeth, what your mightyeſt father Henrye began, youre godlyeſt brother furthered, that you euen you ſhould finiſhe and accomplyſhe. Thoughe Foxes barke and howle, though Sanbaliet and the Gentyles rulers with al their might and power withſtande it. The lord of Hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes he is, who byds you buyld: men they are
<pb facs="tcp:4513:9"/>that withſtand you. As in the perſon of god ſpeaketh Eſaye to this effecte. I, I am he who comforte the. Who then art thou that feareſt a mortall, or the ſonne of man, whoe ſhall become as haye? I haue put my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in thy mouthe, and with the ſhadowe of my hande ſhyelded the. That I may plante the heauens, and ſettle the earth: that it may be ſayde, to Syon, to Englande, my people art thou. Wherefore moſte humble thankes we yeelde the god of Sabaoth, who ſo hathe armed and aſſiſted youre valyaunte courage, in finiſhynge ſo perfectlye and boldelye thys his buſineſſe: as nor the dartes of enuy haue pearced you, nor the ſhotte of malyce ſhaken you, nor the wyles of your ennemyes ſnared you, nor the enmye campe of Sathan ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne you. We greete wel alſo our chriſtian Nobilitye, who prouoked by your pryncelye preſydent, and enflamed wyth gentilmanlye courage, doubted not to folowe the call, and authoritye of theyr guyde and Capitayne.</p>
            <p>Yea, ſo to folowe, as they bluſhed not, to ſet to theyr handes, to employ theyr councel and trauayle, to repayrynge and buyldynge thys heauenly frame. Proceede therefore, proceed O moſt noble Quene, wyth this your noble trayne, in ſettyng like rooffe and ende to your beginninges. But ſo haue you a Mayden Queene begonne, ſo beganne youre brother a chylde, and kynge: as ye ſeeme to ſhadowe all your grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfathers &amp; great grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſyres, to haue lyghtned your owne name, and vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced an enſeygne, and glyſteryng paterne to all
<pb facs="tcp:4513:9"/>your famelye and poſteritye. As you haue begonne therefore, ſo proceede. Though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loane, though a woman. So wonteth Chriſt to daunt the world. Not in mennes myght, but enfantes, ſucklynges, women. Debbora, brake the Iron Charrettes of Labinus the Cananite. Iudith ſlewe Holofernes. Heſter ſaued the Iewes condemned to dye, from the rampyng mouth, and yawninge Iawes of death. Nor is he ſole, whom god aſſiſteth. Who ſeeth Gods campe. As Iacob agaynſt Eſau. Whoſe mounte is enuyroned wyth horſe and fierye chares. As againſt the king of Siria the prophete Elizeus. Howe are ye deſolate, when god encampeth in the ſyghte of his ſeruauntes? So as Dauyd ſole, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not thouſandes of enemyes. For the lord was with him. Who can when him pleaſeth from heauen commaund whole legions. He fyghteth not with noumber, but wyth hys only breath, proſtrateth &amp; felleth kings. Holy warre wyl he wage for you his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dmayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That onely he may tryumphe, who onely is the mightieſt champion, and nobleſt conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. But whereto teaſe I and prouoke you to this chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> battaile, of your ſelfe, through the holy ſpirites inſpiracion, prone enough? Or wheretoe mention I warre, where no ſuſpicion of warre, no campe, no foe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth? God hauinge on all ſides planted peace, and graunted all nacions tyme and place of reſt? All iarres appeaſed at home: al broy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les buryed abroade? O meruaylous good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God. O deepe iudgementes, whyche
<pb facs="tcp:4513:10"/>no obliuion ought raſe: worthy tremblynge and honour of all poſteritye. Cal to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete thought, and mind (O Queene) what ſtraunge and huge wonders, howe ſinguler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye, and wonderouſly, the prouidence of our God, hath wrought. And ouerrunne atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuelye, onelye the courſe of theſe nyne later yeares. So ſhall you ſee the lorde and God of vengeaunce, hath ſcattered his foes, with his onelye becke and countenaunce.</p>
            <p>Snaught hence, the butchers of his ſaincts, from amiddes theyr ſlaughters, walowyng in theyr chyefe delyght and calmeſt quiete. At home in your England, in maner at one ſtroke, mowed of many Byſhoppes, wyth the Cardynall and theyr head. In Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſomewhat afore, wyth a ſtretched out arme, ſmytte Dukes and Byſhoppes, war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryng agaynſt the godlye. In Italye at the ſelfe inſtante, typpled three or fower Popes with the ſelfe cuppe of madnes. Whiſtynge the Emperoures deathe enſuynge, and the kyng your neyghbour late amids hys try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes, after his vayne and ſmoakye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and the bloudy decree of his crueltie pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blyſhed, ſlayne wyth the ſelfe ſtaffe of God. So as more princes and Prelates haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len by his hand, then the ſword and fyer of Tyraunts. What nowe they be, it lieth not in my power to determyne. What lyuynge they were, hereby appeareth. That not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the realmes where they raygned, ſeeme caſed and lyghted, of a heauier yoake and maſſe then Ethna: but euen whole Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome <pb facs="tcp:4513:10"/>laugheth, and ioyeth it hath vomyted out ſo ſtrong a venime. Whoſe ſpyrytes I diſquiete not. Ne doth my talke nowe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batte with the dead. Woulde they had bene here good, hereafter ſaynctes. Onely meant I hereby (O moſt gracious Quene) to im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prynte in all Chriſtendome, deeper memory of Gods prouidence. Continually to behold his gentlenes towardes the veſſelles of his mercye: and iuſt ſeueritye, towardes his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes: rentyng wyth all cruelty and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyles rage, Chryſtes frendes &amp; brethren.</p>
            <p>A worthye conſideracion, wherein oughte anker, as well the thoughtes of the godlye that ſuffer, for theyr comforte: as the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vngodlye, to moue theym while time is to turne to the Lorde. Thus much ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wrote I to you, that ſeynge God fygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for you and yours, you qwayle not that hawetines of courage. But rather more ſtoutely withſtand your foes. Seruyng vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtanderd of that general and captaine who is God almightye. But though name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to you I haue thus much ſayde, of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude the fourth parte of Nobilite yet meant I by you to counſayle al Nobles, burieng al baſenes and weaknes of ſtomacke, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cheriſhe, defende, and mayntayne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayned, religion with theyr councell, autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritye, myght, and force.

So alwayes wyſe men gladlyeſt proue theyr force on ſome precious thyng: and therfore are both more hyghly prayſed, &amp; more plenteouſlye guerdoned. Wherfore,
<pb facs="tcp:4513:22"/>ſyth at this day, almoſt euerye ſtate, &amp; euen the pillers of kingedomes, ſtaye on the counſaile wil &amp; authority of the Nobility: and hit (wherſo it come) is al waies honoured and eſtemed: He then moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly &amp; profitablye beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth his trauaile, who learneth it yet rude, healeth it helples, reformeth it diſordred, and reſtoreth if loſt. That, whereof miſordred the wofull wracke of the commen welth might enſue: of it wel ordred the chiefeſt commodities might growe. For, they be the heades they the ſtomakes and hearts of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales. So that who coueytes the ſafette of the other partes, muſt of neceſſity firſt miniſter to theſe. That they may conceyue moſte deepely, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour moſt ſuttelly, foreſee moſt ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they maye deryue and ſpreade as through vaynes into euerye other parte, parcel of theyr commodities.</p>
            <p>For they, be both the eyes, and eares of prynces, to ſee, heare, and foreſee, ſuch thinges, as be not onely profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them ſelues, but alſo commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; holeſome to others. And as they

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch meane and rule is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and preſcribed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they may learne to ſerue the firſt politikely, low ly and honourablye, to rule the other orderly, louingly, and vprightly.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, who ſo enſtrueteth anye one man with preceptes and inſtituci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of learning to liue morallye, and amend his maners: he trulye is to be eſtemed, and deemed a worthye man. But who enformeth a whole houſe and family, howe it may houſholdlye be guided, is farre greater. Who lear neth then, how men may politykelye gouerne theyr common wealth: he tru lye, muſt nedes be farre better pryſed than all the reſt. In like maner, who yeldes a Noble man either learnedder or better, cauſeth not that one or a fewe become more helthefull: but that many yea the whole commen wealth is the better, and more ſound. This to do are two fortes of men requiſite. Thone to poynte and foreſhewe the waye: thother to folowe it foretold.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4513:23"/>
            <p>The fyrſt ought to brynge diligence, the other obedyence: they, not be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieued to teache, the other not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to learne. For painful teachers do in one workno vnprofitable ſeruice both to the prynce, his ſubfectes, &amp; the Nobles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. And the learners, this gayne, that they vauntage not all onely them ſelues, but learne their deuoyre bothe in humble ſeruyce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes theyr Princes, and in honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable gouernemente ouer theyr peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>The fyrſte forte therfore,<note place="margin">Teaching of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litye.</note> (fyrſt to ſpeake of them) ought paynefullye to teache the nobles, and often and glad ly to haunt theyr houſen. That lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them, they maye learne in all thinges wel to welde theyr liues, and wiſely to gouerne common charges: that theyr life incurre no infamy, but they perfourme theyr duties with the princes fauour, and the commen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of theyr countrey. There are in dede bookes alreadye erſant of the teaching and framing of princes, but thoſe preceptes, though ofte they may
<pb facs="tcp:4513:23"/>be applyed, and are in deede common to all men: neuertheles', ſyth other is the perſon of a prince, other of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, one, theyr eſtate as lordes, other as ſubiectes: The ſelfe ſame preceptes, as to rulers and princes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not alwayes feetly ſcrue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

So that, as it were with their bytte they manege &amp; tourne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they pleaſe. To conclude, Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
<pb facs="tcp:4513:24"/>is alſo combred with his faultes: which it be houeth it to knowe. But, knowe it ſhall not but it heare them. Heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it can not but they be told. Told they be not. For wher the eares ſtand open to flattery, there wont the gates to be cloſed to aduiſement and truth. And therfore commenly they ſe not their diſeaſes, wherewyth they are of cuſtome combred, and enwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped but firſt they be openly printed.</p>
            <p>So that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues may reade, and by reading vnderſtand them of wrytten bookes, which frely roame and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eche where, and abaſhe not to tell the truthe.

            <p>Now (next to ſpeake of learners) in vayne teach they,<note place="margin">Nobilitie ought learne.</note> if theſe eyther heare not, or necligently harken. Wherfore as it is theyr charge to teach ſoundly: ſo is it theſe mens, to obey theyr tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. For, if they ſtrayghtly requyre and of duty chalenge of theyr ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to do theyr commaundements, in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feling
<pb facs="tcp:4513:24"/>toyes, I will not ſay vnlawful, ſometime in deede impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to any part of bliffull life: them ſelues not to obey thoſe that teache them faithfully ſuch things, as tend to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity &amp; profite as wel of the commen as pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate welth, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> health of their ſoules: is the poynt of arrogant min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and altogether diſſolute. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by no meanes, this our true and perfecte noble, whom in this booke (God helpynge) we will frame: ſhall once offend. But this is chiefely to be ſought, that he remember what cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, and howe great a charge is caſt and layd on him of God. For ſuch as are noble are cleare and bryghte, on whom all mens eyes and countenaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces gaſe. And therfore ſo they walke in the eies and ſight of al men, ſo are they viewed and pried at by euery one that no fact, no dede of theyrs may be darke becauſe of theyr Nobilitye.</p>
            <p>Where others of the commen ſorte, ſtyll lurke in darkenes, nor almoſt ſee anye, nor are ſeene of others.</p>

For it is not ſo fightlye, but farther remoued from the eies. Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes therefore in a noble man, famous through the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendacion of his ſtock and linage, are farre more haynous then in other of the meaner ſorte. As well, becauſe they are more ſeene and marked of all men: as alſo, for that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man the nobler he is, the leſſe ought to be blemiſhed with vices, and more embelyſhed with vertues. Dron kennes, what fober man denyes to be a groſſe and filthy fault enough in all men? But a poore knaue or a beggar to ſe dronke, is neyther new nor rare. So much the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> altereth the crime Why ſo? For, if a noble man ſinne, he offends hurtfully to the deſtruction of many, and hales with him many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes both of his cryme and payne.</p>
            <p>Small doubt it is, but there were (yea often) amonges the Romaynes many cupſhotten, yea and ſometimes plaine dronken. Yet reade we, dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

It is permitted them ſometimes to toye, to tryfle, to dalye, childiſhelye to obſerue wakes and typple: when moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent were a Prince or Noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhuld be watchefull and ſober. The preſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent moſt worthy memory of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban Captayne Eoamimendas,</hi> I can in no wyſe ouerpaſſe: worthy of all Nobles that will ſteare in the common welth and trauayle in publike affayres and ſeruice, to be worne in common talke &amp; imitated in theyr liues. Who while the Citeſens of <hi>Thebes,</hi> gaue theym ſelues to feaſting, banketting, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue cheare: was eſpyed by certayne his familiers, walkinge ſole-ſadde, and mourning, to trudge haſtelye to

For otherwiſe, if the captaines, yf the princes, yf the magiſtrates, in comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bankettes ſhould licenciouſly partake with the reſt, that Citye would ſoone berome (as the ſame <hi>Epamirumdas</hi> other where ſayd), a flat and playne yarde, and in maner a ſtage open to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and inuaſion of all men. Others, eke are lycenſed by commen conſente to ſleape. But we read in Scipio ſlepe was erſt muche noted: where other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he was both a moſte watchefull and valiaunt Captayne. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cato</hi> the elder ſayeth, that ofte by night he roſe, and neglecting the care of houſholde, cared for the ſtate of the common wealth: thinkinge belike, it behoued him to wake while others flept. But hereof what doubt we? ſith <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the ſeconde of <hi>Homeres Ilyades</hi> ſignifyed the ſame to <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſent him the God Slepe with this embaſſy.</p>

               <hi>Great ſhame it is al night a Prince to ſlepe, VVho ſhould his realme &amp; countrey care to kepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men alſo commenlye, in all other thinges, in all eſtates, but chiefelye in the worthyeſt, awayte not ſo much what to prayſe as carpe, nor what is wel done as what yll. For ſeing them bett in golde and ſiluer, their gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous garmentes, golden fingers, and al about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſemely &amp; wel beſene: they wene theyr inward minde ſhould aun ſwere theyr outward gliſtering: that they ſhould ſurmount the reſt in ſtore of wiſedome, quicknes of inuention, weyght of counſell, and ſincerenes of lyfe. That from ſo fayre and comelye countenaunce, ſhoulde procede wyſe talke, and ſpiced with learning. But if contrary wiſe, it happen that ſome one richely cladde, talke either filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye or fooliſhlye: they crie forthwith with <hi>Diogenes.</hi> A leaden blade out of an yuery ſcabard. And (as graueli and farre aboue the reache of a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher preacheth <hi>Salomon</hi>) a golden ring in the noſet brilles of a Swyne.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4513:27"/>
            <p>Then commonly they whiſper, and priuely mutter, that in that gorgeous cladde body indweith a bare and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſoule. Wherfore the auctority of the perſonage he beareth, &amp; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the burthen which he weldeth, ought to prouoke a noble and lofty ſto make, to heare and lyſten thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whereby he maye worthelye and honourablye mayntayne his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and ſupport his charge.</p>
            <p>Which ſith it is ſo, to ende at laſt this tedyous talke, I determine it the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of teachers painefully to enſtruct, and of Nobles lowely to learne.</p>
            <p>But what may we deeme the cauſe whye neyther the one nor the other aunſwere theyr charge? For very few ſe we, that willinglye geue theim ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to this trauayle of teachinge: but as fewe knowe we, that taught, will vnderſtand or amend. For, wereit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, we ſhuld haue greater ſtore of true Nobles: that is, good, godlye, wyſe, and learned. Truly, as ſarre as I can reache, two ſtayes chiefelye let, that men in theſe dayes neither write
<pb facs="tcp:4513:27"/>nor ſpeake frely of the ſtate of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. Firſt, for they vnderſtand the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking and compaſſing of ſo great a charge, to be farſd full of hardenes and peryll. For hard ſemeth it to him, whoſe ſtile is baſe thinne, and leane, to wryte ought of the Nobility, of the moſt honourable eſtate, of the flower of the common wealth. For it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him, who ſpeaketh of the highe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of that degree, and of ſuche men, to vſe a ſtately, high, and loftye ſtyle: leaſt the barennes and leaneneſſe of his talke, rather diſhonour the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtye of ſo honourable perſonages, then aduaunce or honour them. Further, this cauſe requireth ſuch one, as hath long trauayled therin, and long bene conuerſannt with ſuche ſorte of men, who hath groaped theyr mindes and meaninges, and nearely viewed theyr maners and vſages. Next, peryllous and ſcarcely ſafe thinke they it, chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in theſe enuious and ſuſpicious dayes, euen to whiſper ought cyther of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or other: whom vnleſſe ye clawe they will kicke. And not, ſceld bath he
<pb facs="tcp:4513:28"/>yll ſpedde, who writeth agaynſt him, that may write his death. For there is almoſt none, no not of the commen ſorte, who wonderful lye pryſeth not him ſelfe. And, for the moſt parte, the more honourable we be, the leſſe we liſt be admoniſhed or reproued. For willingly wonres euery man to heare his owne prayſes or vertues, and gladly beholdes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Table of his ſhape and ſeemelines: but his faultes, his ſpottes, his deformity hardly abydes repreſented to his eyes. And (for all blame beares with it a ſtinge) nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fereth, nor licenſeth others to control him. Whence it appeareth, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely men confeſſe this matter moſt profitable and neceſſary to be treated of, but for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> frowardenes of the times had rather whiſt for dread of dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. Howebeit that to dreade no cauſe, ſo they teache profitablye and gentlye. The profite pertaines to the taught And every man not altogether fooliſh abideth, yea coueteth, to heare the thinges that tend to his profyte and commodity.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4513:28"/>
            <p>Our Noble man therfore, will beare with him who holeſomely counſayles him,<note place="margin">Counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors muſt be heard.</note> and abide it ſo the nede requyre) to be euen chidde for his deſert. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this I wiſhe and warne them, in this entry to my trauayle, frendlye to accepte aduiſemente: that what good men tel them frely, not ſharpely: that they take paciently not diſdainefully. For, better is it dayntye eares be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, then the whole body whyrled into hell. Better to be whipped with the tongue of man, than the rodde of God.

Where what a man is, what humanity, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnknowen. Whereof I ſaye litle.

            <p>And neither doth he cut or ſeare hym when he may cure him with potions, with oyntments, or with gentle plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. It is no medecine, that in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge the ſore parte of the commen

            <p>Or (if neede ſo require, yf at home e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges theym ſelues bate can not be quayled and quieted) procure thoſe to whoſe power it appertayneth, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the authoures of ſedicion, not rage on the whole order: But mowe of yll heades, as infections and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues of commen weales.

For noughte els is warre, than meere fury and madnes, wherein not aduice, but raſhenes, not righte but rage ruleth, and rayneth. We muſt therfore trye all meanes, ere we flye to force. We muſt fight with reaſons not weapons. We muſt runne to the counſaylours. But in common cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes (ſay they) is no place for the poore.

To our purpoſe it ſhal ſuffiſe, to haue ſaid thus much. This is therfore the firſte branche of Nobilitie.

That ſo much honor may ſeme due to their aunceſtours, as both their ſame was ſatiſfied, and theyr heyres payed of the ouerplus.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4513:56"/>
            <p>An other ſorte of Nobility there is, begonne of it ſelfe: famous throughe no commendacion of houſe or armes, but nobled by her owne dedes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.<note place="margin">Newe ſprong Nobilitie</note> Such the <hi>Romaines</hi> termed new men. Which leaſt I ſeeme wythoute booke or witneſſe to affirme not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme: <hi>Appyan</hi> a <hi>Greeke</hi> writer of the <hi>Romaine</hi> hiſtory, witneſſeth with theſe wordes. Them call the <hi>Romaines</hi> newe who not by their aunceſtours, but of them ſelues waxt famous. As contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, Gentlemen we terme thoſe, that haue continued from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the nation, whoſe aunceſtors were neuer bonde, nor euer ſtaynde with treaſon. But though it be great to deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of great houſe: yet greater is it to be great him ſelfe. And better to begin then end thy houſe: as alſo to be good then borne of good. As writeth that worthy <hi>Gregory Nazienzent.</hi> Hit behoueth to ouerrunne, not lagge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde thy kinne. Therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of birthe was vphrayded <hi>Soſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> he aunſwered he ought be ſo much the more eſtemed, for his houſe began at him. Likewiſe <hi>Ciccro</hi> refoyneth to

               <hi>Saluſt.</hi> Who, where men thought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had borne office, he would haue auoyded or chaunged the name of <hi>Cis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero:</hi> vowed to endeuoure to yelde it more famous, then euer was the <hi>Catos Catulles,</hi> or the <hi>Scaures.</hi> Whiche howe he perfourmed, well can thankefull poſterity witneſſe. Neyther are theſe newe nobles any leſſe prayſe worthy, then, the auncientſt: if with right foote and by ſtreight pathe, they aſpice to honoures. For thother are in maner feathered with others plumes. Theſe with their owne vertues: They as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yuie &amp; vine leane on others proppes. Theſe, as the fiſhe <hi>Trochus</hi> is reported to engender with him ſelfe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue: ſo be the firſt begetters of kinne name, and honour to their poſteritye, But more to cleare the matter wyth experience, became not <hi>Romulu</hi> of a heard, the king and founder of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne</hi> ſtate? Or did not <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius</hi> a yong Impe, buſied in entending his ſhepe, from his countreye coate ſcale the heyghthe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romayne ſcepters?

Valerius Coruinus</hi> a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, witneſſeth the <hi>Conſulſhyppe</hi> was communicated with them: As the price, not of bloud, but vertue. And therfore reede we, that euen from the plough and Houell, many were called to the <hi>Senate</hi> to the <hi>Dictatourſhyppe,</hi> and ſtatelieſt honors. Truly to paſſe by prophane matters, God it is, who rayſeth the poore from the dunghil as <hi>Saul, Dauid,</hi> and others. Many, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arbiter and dyſpenſer of humayne happes, maketh of ſlaues Lordes, of <hi>Rhetors, Conſuls:</hi> from baſe eſtate and fortune, lifteth to the higheſt roomes and houors whom him lifteth. which well knew that <hi>Pagane Poete Heſiode.</hi> Who, in the entrye to his treatiſe of workes and daies, mouing this doubt whence it proceded, that ſome were Noble, others baſe: anſwereth. Of the
<pb facs="tcp:4513:57"/>wyl of God.</p>
            <p>The third and Nobleſt ſorte,<note place="margin">Nobility matched with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note> is not ſimple, but compounde of eyther, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtinge of ſuche, as with theyr owne trauayle, giſtes, and ornaments, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyſie, and encreaſe thenheritaunce, of the recetued name from theyr aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours. So, as they be not onely parte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of theyr Nobilitie, but reſemble them alſo, in imitacion of their dedes: Not only euening but euen ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them. Which, that nobleſt <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> prince of Philoſaphers, ſee meth to haue ſignified, when, demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded what was Nobility, he defineth it, the iuſte and euen temperature of body and minde. So, as they ought be not onely meanely, and ſo muche as ſuffiſeth other, endewed with goods and gittes of the body: and commended with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine graces, eyther of fortune, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or kinred: But further oughte couple hereto, the care and tillage of the mynde, ioynte with theyr earneſt endeuoure. That not in body only, but minde, they bee well affected and by ſpoſed.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4513:58"/>
            <p>And beſides the proweſſe of theyr au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours, purchaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues commen dacion of wiſedome. Of this Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the fourth booke of his commen welth, foreſpake <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Sayenge there be three thinges that ſtryue in ciuile equalitie.

               </gap>rtue. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth which we terme Nobilitye, is compounde of the two laſt. For Nobility is lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g laſted welth linked with Fortune. And ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes.</p>
            <p>Theſe therfore are, in my opinion, and as the ciuilians ſeuer theym, the thre ſortes of Nobility. Yf any other be, they maye rightlye be referred to theſe. For <hi>Plato,</hi> as wryteth <hi>Diogenes La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The thirde of thoſe whoſe aunceſtoures were victorious in warres, or crowned for conqueſtes Which three may well be compriſed vnder our firſt parte. Namelye, that Nobilitye, whiche deſcendeth from
<pb facs="tcp:4513:58"/>others. As we imitatinge <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> haue parted it. The fourth ſorte is of ſuch as flouriſhe with the glory of theyr owne dedes. Which parte is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſubiect to our ſecond braunche.</p>
            <p>Nowe therfore, our firſt promiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, the name of Nobility diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and examined, the ſource thereof ſhortly ſhadowed, and her partes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: Let vs agayne peruſe theym more diſtinctly, and aduiſedly, &amp; more at large ouerrunne them. And ſearche as we may, and can, which is the true Nobility. For, both it nedeth ſearche and enquirie: and is of it ſelfe moſte worthy conſideracion. Becauſe not al that haue attaynd the name, haue eke the thing: But they are deemed to haue both name and thing, who clime thoſe ſteppes, wherby rightly we ſcale to dignitie. For to be a noble man is no baſe or raſcall honour. But the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall gift and honourable orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God. Therfore, of him to whom greater charge is credited, more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are required. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> by para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble taught vs in the Scriptures.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4513:59"/>
            <p>That, as he is moſt famous and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhynge, in reuerende names; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable titles, bright Images, Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Pompe, and power: as euerie man vpryſeth to him, and yeldeth him place: as hee is ſaluted, loned, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and byghlyer pryſed then all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: ſo, hee endeuoure to excede all others, in true honor, and Nobilytie. And, as in theſe forreine goodes: ſo in thother greater, hee excell the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Therefore, as Nobles weare ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt roabes, ſo are honorableſt and princelieſt qualities required of them. Unleſſe they wyll betraye the ſtate, that god allotted them, and therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, theyr dignitie, their natiue Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.

For, vice is neither maſked nor honored, with the weed, but rather bewrayed and deſcried. But, admitte they were auncient, riche Noble and good withall. Yet, nought worthe is it, to haue good aunceſtours: but to be him ſelfe good, is ſome what, or rather all. For, as eche man beares the paine of his owne miſdeedes, ſo are children eſteemd by theyr pryuate vertues. Nor ſo muche ſkilles it, who or what man begat thee, as whom and what thou

Truly, as their beautie, helth, and richeſſe, in thy wants ſerue the not as thine: ſo neyther arte thou by them, eyther richer, fairer, or helthier. Wherfore well may the vertue of thy aunceſtours, be in deede a preſident &amp; ſpurre to prouoke thee to wel doinge, that begotten of good thou mayeſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew good: but by theyrs gainſt thou no prayſe, but thou practiſe lyke. Sooner ſhall thy noughtynes clipſe theyr Nobility, then by their worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it ſhadowed, or thou made better. This Nobilitie, is others gifte, not thine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who otherwiſe thincks, is fond &amp; witles.

For not all arces are baſe and filthye, ſo as we ought be aſhamed of theyr knowledge.

            <q>To me the good is Noble, poore or riche.</q>
            <p>Wherby the Poet adiudgeth a good man, a ryght Noble man. For albeit ſome receyue Nobility deliuered them (as it were) other fynde it: Yet neither all they whoſe aunceſtrye longe laſted are borne Nobles, nor theſe new men made Nobles, by whatſoeuer meanes But the fyrſt, by ſuinge the ſteppes of theyr good aunceſtoures: theſe by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuyng the path, that <hi>Hercules</hi> is ſayd to haue propoſed. Of whom <hi>Cicero</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth oute of <hi>Prodicus</hi> the <hi>Sophiſter,</hi> that ſeynge two pathes, he tourned to the ryght not lefte: and leauynge pleaſure the flatterynge dame and the baytes of vices, lyſtned vertue a thryftye and ſober mayden, ſadlye and ſoundlye diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putynge, aſſented to her, and ſerued her. And this is that Nobilitye that fylleth the thyrde roome, when wyth ſtocke and forreyne Nobleſſe, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ornamentes and vertue, (the true honour of the mind) are matched.
<pb facs="tcp:4513:93"/>As <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> defynd wel borne, well manerd. But vertue, albeit in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer home it harboureth, is euer one aye like it ſelfe: Yet (I wot not howe) more ſhineth and gliſtereth in a noble man. Nor coueteth ſo muche the ſhade as Sunne, the couerte as the open lyght, the darke and ſhady laundes, as bryght and Sunnye mountes, where reſort and aſſembly is moſt frequente. For both ſhe honoureth her place, and is honoured by ſuche ſubiecte, as ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth it moſt apparent, and where ſhe brighteſt ſhines. This therfore I adde That no baſe or meane vertue, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in a Noble man, but euen the nobleſt and hygheſt. So as, the deuine bountye and grace aſſiſtynge him, he maye wyſely and tymely mynde, and diligently and faythfullye compaſſe, thoſe thynges, whyche moſt beſee me I ſaye not a man, or free borne, but euen a Noble man. For to ſuch perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who ſo is Noble, is thoughte to haue ſcaled: not onely to haue attaind what is common to all. For in being men partakers of ſpeache and reaſon,
we <pb facs="tcp:4513:93"/>differ from brute beaſtes. In beynge free, we excel bondmen, or thoſe of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile nature: as fooles, or dolts vnfeet for all partes of life. Or <hi>Villens</hi> by warre, in whom natheles, oft lurketh ſecreate fredome and gentry, though maſtred by <hi>Villenage,</hi> it dare not peepe out.

And bee they ſubiects, they are ſo muche more to bee loued, for they yelde them theyr labours, whoſe profites they enioye. As the father to his children, the king to his ſubieccs, the good huſbandman to his grounde: ſo ought the Nobility, be affectioned towards the commens.

Muche muſt he paynefully learne, firmely remember ſtoutely practyſe, and wiſely ſpeake. Which all ought in him excell, where in the common ſorte it ſuffiſeth, al be they meane. For, both he hath all the helpes of practiſe, whyche others want, and the more God hath credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, the ſtrayghter and more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
<pb facs="tcp:4513:144"/>accompte ſhall he render, of hys wordes and deedes. Wherfore dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely, truly, and maruaylouſly, ſayd one of the fathers of the primitiue Church: that hardlye mought Prynce or prieſt be ſaued. Which extendeth to all the burthened, with any harde la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious charge, linked with the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, care, and preſeruation of manye. For who wonteth to foreſee, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, to watche, and wake for others ought alſo abye others treſpaſſes. So payneful and perillous charge is hit, to be a Noble man: if by his example, the ſubiecte bee either offended, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe. For hee ſynneth not ſole, but the contagion of hys dyſeaſe infecteth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And with hys fault, he maketh others faultie, and with hys fall and ruine, debruſeth thouſandes. Nor can alone fall, but his adherents, and ſuch as depende of him, wyll accompanye him. For of much force are they, to the marring or making of cities maners, either deprauinge the Citizins wyth theyr luſtes, and vices: or reforminge them, by the preſidentes of theyr ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and continence.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4513:145"/>
            <p>For it appeareth in hiſtoryes, that as the cities chiefes, ſuche euer was the whole city, and whatſoeuer chaunge of faſhions the prince began, the ſame the people folowed. Which is farre truer, then the conceyte of oure <hi>Plato.</hi> Who thought by the chaunge of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians ſonges, the ſtates of cities wer altered. For truly the Nobles life and liuinge chaunged, who ſeeth not the cities maners chaunge? Wherefore, ſo muche the more hatefullye vicious princes deſerue of the common welth for not onelye theym ſelues embrace vyce, but ſpreade the ſame into the whole ſtate. Nor hurt onelye for they are infected, but alſo for they infecte. And more harme with theyr example then ſinne. For he it lawful this once for me to vſe <hi>Cicero,</hi> wordes, in hys booke of lawes, to purchaſe my talke more authority. Of neceſſitye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ought noble men be good. Both, for them ſelues and others: that they may trayne manye in theyr vertues, not vices. Of which ſorte of Nobles, the leſſe plenty there hath bene hither
<pb facs="tcp:4513:145"/>to, the earneſtlier, ought al men, with theyr whole mighte and power ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: that theſe of our dayes encreaſe the number, and euen drowne theyr aunceſtours, ſo to become more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and acceptable to all men. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in hys dayes wryteth <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in hys polytikes, that a ryghte No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, was a rare ſighte. Nobilitie (quod hee) and vertue, are founde in fewe, but ryches in many. For ſcarſe any where a hundred Nobles, or good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but infinite ſwarms of ryche, eche where may you finde. Thus wryteth he. Why ſo? The falſe opinion of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie mocketh them, for they wene them ſelues happy enoughe, for their diſcent from Nobles. And reſtinge on this vayne confidence, reache no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But truly ſaith <hi>Plato,</hi> loue bredth of neede. For the needy ſeeke. Whoe ſeeke finde. But ſuche as weene they abound, and thinke they haue raught the chiefeſt bliſſe, ſlay as at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gole, nor mind to run further in that race. For who ſeeketh the Phiſician, but firſt he feeie diſeaſe? Chriſt calleth the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe,
<pb facs="tcp:4513:146"/>and laden. Them promiſeth he reſt and diſburdening. For the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with no burthen, neede none to vnlade theim. Therfore (for I returne to my purpoſe) the fewer Nobles we haue, the more conſtantly and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt they trauayle, to attayne thys chriſtian, geaſon, and vnwonted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and excellence. And with all ſpeede, cleare and ſcoure out the ſtaine that ſo long hath fretted their Noble names. In whom all men, as I ſayd, ſeeke and miſſe the perfect duties, and orders of the excellentſt. So, ſhal they bothe accompliſhe theyr dutye, and ſcape iuſte blemiſhe of infamye, and further with theyr example, &amp; aſpire to the glory of true Nobilitye.</p>

But the better to ſkyll and learne to practiſe theſe, let him at his owne home, as in a free ſchoole ſhape &amp; forme him ſelfe: before thence he be thruſte abroade as into an open ſtage before he determine with others in the churche diuine ordinances reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, and ciuile duties towards all and euery men.

            <p>The firſt pryuate vertue, and leaſte ſightly, but not leaſte ſeemely, to bee coueited and honord of a Noble man: is <hi>Temperance.</hi> which, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the pleaſures of the paunche, and belye. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſtretcheth farther, whom wee at this preſent gladlier fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe.

<pb facs="tcp:4513:147"/>Wherin, all her power is cloſed. That a Noble man thinke modeſtlye of him ſelfe, liue temperatlye, and continently, behaue hym ſelfe mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and ſoberly in all things.</p>
            <p>For ſo her whole nature, though not moſte ſuttellye boulted, yet maye hee plainlieſt vnderſtod. For truly it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, that as wormes ſooneſt breed in moſt precious woode, ſo theſe thre vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Pryde, Pleaſure, Riot, or exceſſe: (I wot not how) in maner naturallye cleaue and creepe into Nobles. Pride therfore, ſhall modeſtye maſter. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhall continence tame. Exceſſe ſhall modera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and ſobrietie banyſhe.

So be his minde formed at home, ſo his thoughtes diſpoſed, that he accompte him ſelfe noughte better for the acceſſe of any forren hap.</p>
            <p>But ſo farre forth, as he proueth him ſelfe a man, by vertue. Whence <hi>(Vir)</hi> the name of man is borowed. This vertue the deuines terme humilitie.</p>

As thoughe, the quantitye of pryce, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the goodnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vittayle. In auncient times, rareſt was the vſe of wine.

But by the Conſuls, the forren &amp; ſtraunge wines, were by litle and litle brought in.

            <p>So ſtealyngly creapt in dronkennes.
<pb facs="tcp:4513:160"/>at length, of ſuch impudence, that <hi>M. Antonius,</hi> wrote a booke of his owne dronkennes.

But now, but on all partes they glyſter, with longe and maſſie chaine, with flauntynge plume, with coſtlye and rare araye: ſcarſe thinke they them ſelues accomp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted gentlemen. And as whylome <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> neuer doubled the weare of one garmente: ſo theſe exceede in chaunge, and hit moſt ſumptuous.

            <p>But as to women, ther is a manyfeſt decree in the ſcriptures, enacted by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule Apoſtels,</hi> that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede not in ſumptuouſnes, that with modeſt habite, ſhamefaſtnes, and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, they attyre them ſelues.

Nor thinke they theym ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues happyer, for theyr riche &amp; coſtly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes: but acknowledge their coates the couers of many cares.

For, not onelye are good Nobles more carefull and combred then others: but alſo, more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and proane to peril. Whych con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideracion bringeth modeſty, and ſelfe contempt. Hereto alſo calleth them, the baſenes of the thinges, that ſwell them. For gold, ſiluer, veluet, nought els renoumeth, then mans fonde eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macion. The firſt, being onely frutes of the earthe, the baſeſt elemente: the laſt, the ſeede of a ſimple worme, of the people <hi>Seres,</hi> whiche two monkes brought from <hi>Serindia,</hi> a citye of <hi>Indye,</hi> to <hi>Iuſtmian</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſhipped thence into <hi>Italye,</hi> and other partes of <hi>Europe.</hi> For, of her ſeede couered with dunge, ſylke wormes bred, fed wyth mulberye leaues, ſpinne ſilke. And therefore, the emperours eſteemed ndt ſo hyghely Silkes, &amp; Veluets, whiche <hi>Aurelianus</hi> had neuer in his wardrobe.
<pb facs="tcp:4513:165"/>Sayeng, he would neuer paiſe thread with golde. For then was an ounce of ſilke, ſolde for like weyght of golde. <hi>Alexander Seucrus</hi> alſo, ſeeld ware ſylke, veluet neuer. So nothinge was anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie proud of this wormes flyece.</p>

Wherfore, either the matter whereof it is wroughte, or the commennes and ſtalenes, ought breed contempt therof in a noble courage. And cauſe, that not ſo much with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren as home cloth, he clothe him ſelfe.

<pb facs="tcp:4513:165"/>But, bothe the deare price of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, and fondenes of faſhyons, is much reprehenſible.
